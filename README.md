# Lab Dash
This is an open-source user interface designed to be your locally hosted homepage for your homelab/server. 

# Installation
This only needs docker to be installed. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

# Usage
This PWA can be installed as an "app" on your computer/phone as a PWA (Progressive Web App) via chrome browser (or safari on iOS/iPad OS).
It can be accessed locally via any web browser via `http://localhost:2022` or `192.168.x.x:2022` which should be your servers local IP address.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you want to use your server's IP address (so any device on your LAN/WAN can access the Jellyfin Console you need to have the .env file with `HOST_IP=192.168.x.x` filled out with your server's local IP address. This needs to be at the same level directory as the docker-compose file.)

Simply copy/download the docker-compose.yml or add it to an existing docker-compose file. Optionally include the `.env` file with your servers LAN/WAN IP address. Then run the docker-compose file.
